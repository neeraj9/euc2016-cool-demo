A cool demo for EUC2016 showcasing Erlang microkernel powered by Rumprun
unikernel.

## Motivation

The idea is to demonstrate building a cool project from scratch (kind-of)
based on the Keynote by Fred Hebert at the
[Erlang User Conference 2019](http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2016#speakers).
This project uses the rebar3 plugin
<https://github.com/neeraj9/rebar3_uerl_crud>
which is based on <https://bitbucket.org/ferd/rebar3_crud>. 

## Thanks

Hope you had run running the project.
